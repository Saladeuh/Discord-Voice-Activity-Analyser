# Discord-Voice-Activity-Analyser
A console tool witch analyse voice Discord's personal data

# What does it do?
- Compute how many days you spent in Discord voice channels in your life
- Show your 10 most long vocal conversations, without disconnect or chdnnel change
- Show ordered voice channels by the time you spent in

# How to use?
To use it, run the .exe and put your unzipped [Discord personal data package](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004027692-Requesting-a-Copy-of-your-Data) in the same folder.

# How it works?
Discord don't provide direct datas about your personal voice channels use. So the program search informations about connect/disconnect voice channels in the analititcs events. These datas are not exact but I think enough precise. It's important that your personal datas stay only on your computer, so it's what I choose to dev a console app and not a website. The analyse is fully executed on your computer.
